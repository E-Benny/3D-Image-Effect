## 3D Image Effect
This HTML file displays a 3D version of two images that reveals hidden information when a cursor hovers over them.

## Installation
This HTML file does not need Yarn or NPM to install the application. Simply open the HTML file to use it.

## Project Status
The project runs as expected. I did not implement any JavaScript or PHP code, thus any information entered into the form will not trigger any event.

## Design Execution
The design for this project was mainly handled using CSS. I apid huge detail to the clip-path and transform functions to allow the image to be mobile.
